## Part B — Branch → File → Pull Request

**Goal:** Practice the standard GitHub workflow used in real projects.

From this point on:
- Do **not** edit `main` directly
- All work happens in your own branch

### Your task
1. Create a **new branch**
2. Inside the folder `students/`, add a new file named with your first name  
   (example: `students/javier.md`)
3. Add the content described below
4. Commit your changes to your branch
5. Open a **Pull Request** into `main`
6. Go and accept a Pull Request

### What to put in your file

Answer briefly:
- One thing you understand about GitHub so far
- I understand how to make a new branch and how to view/edit off of other branches.
- One thing that is still confusing
- I'm still getting used to the interface, but everything you've explained so far has made sense.

I understand how I can use this app to collaborate with others
I still need to get more familiar with the controls
## Part C — Editing `in your branch` and pull request (Everyone)
