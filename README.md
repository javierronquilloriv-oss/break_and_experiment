## Part A — Editing `main` (Everyone)

**Goal:** Experience what it means to work on a shared file.

Instructions:
1. Open this `README.md`
2. Click the ✏️ Edit button
3. Add your name under the section **Class Participants**
4. Commit your change directly to `main`

Do not worry about doing this “right”.
We will change how we work in Part B.

### Class Participants

- Javier Ronquillo

## Part B — Branch → File → Pull Request

**Goal:** Practice the standard GitHub workflow used in real projects.

From this point on:
- Do **not** edit `main` directly
- All work happens in your own branch

### Your task
1. Create a **new branch**
2. Inside the folder `students/`, add a new file named with your first name  
   (example: `students/javier.md`)
3. Add the content described below
4. Commit your changes to your branch
5. Open a **Pull Request** into `main`
6. Go and accept a Pull Request

### What to put in your file

```md
# Your Name
Answer briefly:
- One thing you understand about GitHub so far
- One thing that is still confusing

## Part C — Editing `main` (Everyone)

**Goal:** Experience what it means to work on a shared file with the flow above

Instructions:
